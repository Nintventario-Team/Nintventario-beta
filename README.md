2. **Set up the virtual environment**
   - Once the repository is cloned, access the backend directory as follows: `cd Nintventario-beta/backend`.

     ![Backend Path example](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/4-backend-path-example.png)

   - In the backend folder, create a Python virtual environment by executing:
     - On Windows: `python -m venv environmentName`. Then activate the virtual environment by running `./environmentName/Scripts/activate`.
     - On Linux/macOS: `source environmentName/bin/activate`.

3. **Install Django dependencies**
   - Once you are in the virtual environment, install the `requirements.txt` file by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Then, check if you have the following packages by running the command `pip list`.

     ![Pip List example](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/5-pip-list.png)

4. **Configure the database**
   - Start XAMPP and make sure the MySQL and Apache servers are running.

     ![Xampp configuration](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/6-xampp configuration.png)

   - Go to your browser and put `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` in the search bar.

     ![Go to PhpMyAdmin](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/7-search-bar.png)

   - Then, create a new database for your project from phpMyAdmin.

5. **Configure the Django backend**
   - Go to the `settings.py` file in the `backend/backend_nintventario` configuration folder.
   - Configure the connection to the MySQL database you just created with your credentials.

     - **Engine:** `django.db.backends.mysql`
     - **Name:** The name of the database you recently created (`database_nintventario`)
     - **User:** Default is `root`
     - **Password:** By default, there is no password
     - **Host:** `localhost`
     - **Port:** Default port is `3306`, you can check this in the XAMPP control panel.

   - Access the backend directory as follows: `cd Nintventario-beta/backend` and activate the virtual environment by `./env/Scripts/activate`.
   - Perform migrations by running `python manage.py makemigrations` followed by `python manage.py migrate`.

6. **Insert data into MySQL**
   - Once migrations are executed, go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin/` in the browser and enter the database you created (`database_nintventario`).

     ![PhpMyAdmin page](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/11-select-database.png)

   - Go to the `custom_user_category` table, and in the SQL section, execute the category inserts found in the `database_nintventario.sql` file.

     ![Select SQL option](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/12-select-sql.png)
     ![Category insert](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/13-category-insert.png)

   - Repeat the same process for the `custom_user_product` table.

7. **Configure the Angular frontend**
   - In another command line, navigate to the Angular frontend folder as follows: `cd Nintventario-beta/frontend`.

     ![Frontend path example](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/15-frontend-path-example.png)

   - Install dependencies by running `npm install`.

8. **Deploy the website locally**
   - Access the backend directory as follows: `cd Nintventario-beta/backend`, activate the virtual environment by `./env/Scripts/activate`, and run `python manage.py runserver` to start the Django server.

     ![Backend deploy](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/16-django-deploy.png)

   - In another command line, navigate to the Angular frontend folder as follows: `cd Nintventario-beta/frontend` and run `ng serve -o` to start the Angular development server.

     ![Frontend deploy](images%20for%20guides/instalation-requirenments/17-angular-deploy.png)

   - Now you should be able to access the web catalog from your browser by visiting `http://localhost:4200`.
